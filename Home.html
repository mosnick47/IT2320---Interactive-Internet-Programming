            <h2>About the HAKA</h2>
            <img src="images/allBlacksHaka.jpg" alt="All Blacks Haka" height="200" width="300" />
            <p>
                To someone who doesn't know, this may seem like a silly bunch of screaming and funny faces.
                But to the Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealond, this was their war dance. They 
                grunted and made screams and faces with bulging eyes and poking their tounges out to 
                intimidate their opponents and to boost their own morale. The All Black still perform 
                Haka before each and every game. If you want to read more about the haka, <a href="https://hakatours.com/blog/haka-meaning/">click here.</a>
